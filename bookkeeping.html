<h2>Bookkeeping</h2>

<hr>

<ul>
	<li>Bookkeeping is a basic yet highly important financial service often offered by accounting firms. It involves business valuation and recording all transactions which take place within the business.</li>
<br>
	<li>As there may be several accounts owned by the company, it is also essential to determine which account each transaction affects. The accountant or bookkeeper valuates these transactions while making records.</li>
<br>
	<li>Bookkeeping is crucial to every business as none can operate successfully without keeping a record of all its financial transactions. Nevertheless, not every bookkeeper needs to be an accountant by profession.</li>
