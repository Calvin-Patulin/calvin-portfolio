<h2>Auditing</h2>

<hr>

<ul>
	<li>There is a need for financial records to be examined from time to time, checking for errors, and if the business is running in compliance with regulations â€” this is what auditing entails.</li>
<br>
	<li>The auditor is a specialized accountant who works independently and not within the company, and so can form an unbiased opinion about the financial statements of the company, whether it was done fairly, accurately, and in compliance with accounting regulations.</li>
<br>
	<li>An audit firm is a specialized accounting firm and should be hired periodically to audit your business. If there is any error or issue which needs to be addressed, the company will be duly alerted.</li>
</ul>
